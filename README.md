# How do I approach designing software?
  - What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
     - I have a much better understanding of lighting, and different styles of lights. Another skill was learning how materials react to light to help give a scene more impact. Using different colors of lighting to give a scene an atmosphere. Combining multiple objects to create a complex object can be difficult but also a rewarding experience. 
  - What design process did you follow for your project work?
     - The main design process I followed was iteration. I wasn't sure exactly how I wanted the scene to look when I started, but I made slow deliberate changes that brought the scene to life and helped to express the feeling I wanted the scene to give. 
  - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
 	  - Applying iteration would help me to ensure that each new addition or change I made to a program behaved in the way I expected it to. Making changes with each new addition helps to ensure that each area is how I envisioned it. 
# How do I approach developing programs?
  - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
	   - When developing the 3D scene, I had to learn to be adaptable. I am typically stubborn when it comes to setting my mind on something and committing myself to it. However, I lacked the necessary skills and knowledge to do this for the scene. Instead, I realized I needed to be able to make changes to my original plan for the scene to be completed. 
  - How did iteration factor into your development?
	  - My development was completely based on iteration. Making small changes to the positions of the objects, the different materials, and the lighting helped to bring the scene to life. 
  - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
	  - This project helped me to better understand that revisiting old areas of my code, that I had previously considered “done”, could still be better. As I learned new skills throughout the project, I was excited to revisit older areas, and apply my new knowledge to them. 
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    - This project really helped me understand how all the different parts make the whole. It gave my program a visual representation of my knowledge. I couldn’t just make everything at once; I had to create the scene in steps. This has helped me better understand how programs should be structured and given me new insight into the how approaching software development can be handled. 
  - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
     - Being able to provide future co-workers with a visual representation of my ideas can help speed up development as they could use it for reference. Knowing how to create 3D scenes also broadens my skill set and would allow me to take on different roles in a development team.
